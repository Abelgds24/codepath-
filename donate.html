    <p>Donating to causes addressing the impacts of El Niño is crucial as this climate phenomenon triggers severe flooding and droughts. These extreme weather events devastate communities, leading to loss of life, displacement, and destruction of homes and infrastructure. By contributing, you support disaster preparedness, emergency response, and long-term recovery efforts. Your donation can help provide essential resources like clean water, food, shelter, and medical care to affected populations. Furthermore, it aids in building resilient communities, reducing future vulnerabilities to climate-related disasters. Join us in making a meaningful difference in the lives of those impacted by El Niño.</p>
