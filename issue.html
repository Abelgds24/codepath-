    <h1 class="whatnino">What is the El Nino current? (ENSO)</h1>
    <p class="whatninotxt">El Niño is a climate phenomenon marked by the periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, occurring every 2 to 7 years. <br>
    It causes significant global weather changes, such as increased rainfall in South America and droughts in Australia and Southeast Asia.<br> The phenomenon can disrupt marine ecosystems, agriculture, and economies. <br>
     Scientists monitor and predict El Niño to mitigate its impacts through organizations like NOAA.    </p>

        <h1 class="whatnino">How does it affect Ethiopia?</h1>
        <p class="whatninotxt">The 2024 El Niño season is projected to bring heavy rains to Ethiopia’s climate-vulnerable regions, some of which experienced protracted flooding from September 2023 until March 2024. 
            <br> Additional flooding could kill livestock and cause crop losses, driving further food insecurity. <br>
             Heavier rains will also contribute to the spread of mosquito-borne and water-borne diseases, like the ongoing nationwide cholera outbreak. </p>
